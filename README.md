# Nitya Chikankari Website Project

Welcome to the Nitya Chikankari website project! This is an online store where you can showcase and sell beautiful hand-embroidered sarees, kurtis, and other traditional clothing from Lucknow, India. This guide is written for someone with no coding experience, so don’t worry—we’ll walk you through everything step by step!

## What is This Project?

This project is a website built to help you run an online shop for Nitya Chikankari. It allows customers to:
- Browse and view products (like sarees and kurtis) with detailed pictures.
- Add items to a shopping cart.
- Check out and send their order details to a WhatsApp number for processing.
- See special features like zooming into product images and a fun animation when adding items to the cart.

The website is live at: [https://nityachikankari.github.io/NityaStore/]. You can visit this link to see it in action!

## What You’ll Need

You don’t need to be a coder to use or share this project, but here’s what you might need if you want to make changes or show it to someone:
- A computer with internet access.
- A web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox to view the website.
- (Optional) A GitHub account if you want to download or update the files (we’ll explain this later).

No special software or coding skills are required to just look at or use the website!

## How to View the Website

1. **Visit the Live Site**:
   - Open your web browser.
   - Type or paste this link: [(https://nityachikankari.github.io/NityaStore/)] into the address bar and press Enter.
   - You’ll see the homepage with a video, product sections, and navigation links.

2. **Explore the Pages**:
   - Use the menu at the top (Home, Shop, Products, Cart, Collections, About, Contact) to move around.
   - Click "Shop" to see products, "Cart" to view your selected items, and so on.

3. **Try the Features**:
   - Click on a product image in the "Shop" page to zoom in and see details.
   - Click the "+" button on a product to add it to your cart—watch the little image fly to the cart!
   - Go to "Cart," add items, and click "Proceed to Checkout" to send an order to WhatsApp.

## How It Works

Here’s a simple explanation of what happens on the website:
- **Products**: Customers can look at sarees, kurtis, and more. They can zoom into pictures and choose sizes.
- **Cart**: When they add an item, it goes into a virtual shopping bag. The website remembers this using your browser.
- **Checkout**: When they click "Proceed to Checkout," the website asks for their location (using their phone or computer’s location settings) and sends the order details to a WhatsApp number (+8005000099) with a random order number.
- **No Login Needed**: Customers don’t need to sign up—they can shop right away!
